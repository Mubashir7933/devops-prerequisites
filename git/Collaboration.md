🔁 Git Collaboration Workflow: Fork, Push, Pull Request & More
Today, I deepened my understanding of how collaborative development works with Git and GitHub. These are essential skills for contributing to open-source projects and working in team environments.

🔍 What I Practiced:
Forking a Repository:
I forked a public repository on GitHub to create my own copy where I can make changes freely.

Cloning the Repo:
I cloned the forked repo to my local machine
```bash
git clone https://github.com/myusername/project-name.git
```
Creating a New Branch:
I created a feature branch for my changes

```bash
git checkout -b feature-update
```
Opening a Pull Request (PR):
On GitHub, I opened a PR to the original repository, proposing to merge my changes.

🔁 Bonus Git Skills:
git remote -v to check the connected repositories

git fetch to get the latest changes

git pull to sync with upstream changes

git rebase for cleaner commit history (still learning!)

💡 Key Takeaway:
This workflow is the foundation of open-source collaboration. It helps maintain a clean and organized codebase while empowering multiple developers to contribute simultaneously.
