# Git Basics – DevOps Practice Repository

👋 Welcome! This repository documents my hands-on learning of **Git basics using Linux CLI** as part of my DevOps journey.

## 🧠 What I Practiced

As part of my DevOps prerequisites, I focused on learning how Git works under the hood using the terminal. Here’s what I practiced:

- Initializing a Git repository (`git init`)
- Tracking files with `git add` and `git commit`
- Creating and adding remote repositories (`git remote add`)
- Pushing to GitHub (`git push`)
- Pulling changes (`git pull`)
- Cloning repositories (`git clone`)
- Viewing remote connections (`git remote -v`)

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Git
- GitHub
- Linux Command Line (Bash)
- KodeKloud Labs

## 📌 Why This Matters

Understanding Git is a **core skill for DevOps engineers**. It powers:
- Version control
- Team collaboration
- CI/CD pipelines
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

This repo is a marker of my foundational progress before diving into Java, Node.js, and Python-based applications and GitOps workflows.

## 🚀 What’s Next

- Exploring Git branches and merge conflicts
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- Applying Git workflows to real applications in Java, Node.js, and Python

📅 Stay tuned as I keep documenting everything I learn during my DevOps path!
