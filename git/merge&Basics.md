ðŸ“˜ Git Basics: Understanding Branches and Merging
Today, I explored the fundamentals of Git, an essential tool for version control in DevOps and software development. Here's what I learned:

ðŸ”§ What I Covered:
How Git Works:
I learned how Git tracks changes using snapshots and stores project history efficiently through a local repository.

Branches in Git:
Branches allow you to work on features or fixes independently from the main code. I practiced creating, switching, and listing branches using:

```bash
git branch
git checkout -b feature-branch
```
Using git log:
I used git log to view commit history and understand how changes are recorded over time.

Merging Branches:
After completing changes in a feature branch, I merged it back into the main branch using:
```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch
```
ðŸ§  Key Takeaway:
Git branching makes collaboration and experimentation easy. Merging integrates isolated changes safely and efficiently.
