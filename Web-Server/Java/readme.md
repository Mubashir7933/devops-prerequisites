# Java Application – DevOps Learning

🚀 This folder contains my hands-on exploration of Java applications as part of the "Application Basics" section in the KodeKloud DevOps Pre-Requisites course.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- ✅ How Java applications are structured (JARs, WARs)
- ✅ Role of JVM in running Java apps
- ✅ Building and running Java apps from source
- ✅ Packaging and deploying Java-based microservices

## 🛠️ Hands-on Practice

- [x] Compiled and ran a sample Java application using `javac` and `java`
- [x] Explored `.jar` files and classpath
- [x] Deployed a simple REST service locally
